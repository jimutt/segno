# Theming `<segno-player>`

<!-- @decision(DL-015) -->

The player renders into a shadow root, so a site's CSS doesn't reach inside it by accident. It is themed on purpose through three things: custom properties, parts, and container queries. All three are public API, changed only with a new major version.

## Custom properties

Set them anywhere a normal CSS property can go: on `segno-player`, on a class, on `:root`, inside a media or container query. The player reads each with its default as a fallback and never sets them itself, so your values always win.

```css
segno-player {
  --segno-accent: #2f5d8a;
  --segno-page-gap: 2rem;
  --segno-controls-radius: 999px;
}
```

| Property                      | Default                       | What it sets                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--segno-accent`              | `#b3261e`                     | The colour of the bar marker, the note cursor and the controls' accent |
| `--segno-bar-strength`        | `7%`                          | How much of the accent tints the bar marker                            |
| `--segno-bar-fade-in`         | `90ms`                        | How fast the bar marker appears on a new bar                           |
| `--segno-bar-fade-out`        | `260ms`                       | How fast it leaves the previous one                                    |
| `--segno-cursor-width`        | `2px`                         | The note cursor's width                                                |
| `--segno-cursor-strength`     | `55%`                         | How much of the accent colours the note cursor                         |
| `--segno-page-gap`            | `1rem`                        | Space between pages                                                    |
| `--segno-page-background`     | `#fff`                        | The sheet behind each page                                             |
| `--segno-page-shadow`         | a soft shadow                 | The pages' shadow (`none` for flat pages)                              |
| `--segno-controls-background` | `#1d1c1a`                     | The built-in controls' background                                      |
| `--segno-controls-color`      | `#fff`                        | The built-in controls' text and icons                                  |
| `--segno-controls-accent`     | `--segno-accent`              | The play button and the slider's fill                                  |
| `--segno-controls-radius`     | `1.125rem`                    | The controls' corner radius                                            |
| `--segno-controls-gap`        | `1.125rem` (narrow: `0.5rem`) | Space between the controls                                             |
| `--segno-font`                | `inherit`                     | The controls' font                                                     |

The markers are blended with `multiply`, so the notes under them stay black whatever the colour.

The controls default to a dark bar with white text in either colour scheme, keeping playback distinct from the sheet. To follow your site's colour scheme instead, set `--segno-controls-background` and `--segno-controls-color` to your own colours or `light-dark()` pairs. Secondary buttons and dividers derive their colours from the controls' foreground.

## Presets

A preset switches a set of values with one property. Presets use container style queries, which every current browser supports (Firefox from version 151); older browsers ignore them and keep the defaults.

| Property           | Values                      | Effect                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--segno-controls` | `full` (default), `compact` | `compact` shows only the play button and the seek slider, on one line  |
| `--segno-markers`  | `soft` (default), `strong`  | `strong` doubles the bar marker's tint and strengthens the note cursor |

```css
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  segno-player {
    --segno-controls: compact;
  }
}
```

## Parts

For anything the properties don't cover, style the parts with `::part()`:

| Part                               | Element                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `bar-marker`                       | The bar marker (two elements that crossfade)                                            |
| `note-cursor`                      | The note cursor                                                                         |
| `controls-area`                    | The area below the pages that holds the controls (sticky at the bottom of the viewport) |
| `controls`                         | The built-in controls bar                                                               |
| `play-button`, `restart-button`    | Play/pause and back to beginning                                                        |

| `seek`                             | The seek slider                                                                         |

| `tempo-decrease`, `tempo-increase` | The slower and faster buttons                                                           |
| `tempo-value`                      | The current percentage                                                                  |

segno-player::part(page) {
  border-radius: 4px;
}
segno-player::part(controls-area) {
  position: static;
}
```

## Container queries

The player is a size container named `segno-player`: its built-in controls lay out by the player's own width. At 44rem and wider, all controls share one row. Below 44rem, play, restart, time and seeking stay on one row with a settings button; tempo and follow appear in a second row only when that button is opened. Escape closes the panel and returns focus to the button. The compact preset hides restart, time and settings, leaving just play and seek.

A size container doesn't take its width from its content, so in a layout that sizes elements to their content (an inline block, a flex row, an `auto` grid column) give the player a width, `width: 100%` or `flex: 1`, or it collapses to nothing. A site can do the same around the player with its own containers:

```css
.sidebar {
  container-type: inline-size;
}
@container (width < 30rem) {
  segno-player {
    --segno-page-gap: 0.5rem;
    --segno-controls: compact;
  }
}
```

## Your own controls

Put your own controls in the `controls` slot; they replace the built-in ones, and drive the player through its API:

```html
<segno-player pages="…" audio="…" positions="…">
  <button slot="controls" onclick="this.parentElement.paused ? this.parentElement.play() : this.parentElement.pause()">
    Play / pause
  </button>
</segno-player>
```
